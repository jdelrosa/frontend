# Problem Description
Our project will be a small website where information and notes about computer science can be shared with others. Essentially, common problems and solutions to them can be documented so that people with similar issues have a place to go to resolve them. Examples of uses: an error message from an application, how to implement a certain algorithm in a language, etc. If someone is not able to find a solution, then they can make a post in the forum section of the website. The messages will be viewable to the public so that people can help them. Alternatively, the forum can also be utilized as a private chat that specializes with sharing code. 

# Problem Approach
Our application will need two pages: a home page (list of different post titles with filtering features) and a “post” page (a list of posts). Information provided by the user will need to be able to be quickly transformed into a dynamic page, and user submissions must not contain rich media except images, code blocks and bold/italics/underline. The goal of the pages is to make it readable and easier for the user to interact with. Users should be able to filter down the posts and also create their own that can be viewed publicly or privately

# Constraints
We do not have a monetary budget. However, the project must be completed in a very short timeframe, so we must move quickly so that we have enough time to test our project. Also, we will need to find other students around to test our site in this short time frame. We might also need research about using HTML, as this will be the first time some of us use this markup language.

# Measuring Success
We will be finished when the following are achieved: basic pages can be posted and retrieved from the site; users can filter and create their own posts; they can create their own posts that it either public or private; and they can create groups/tags with others.
